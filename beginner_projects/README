seminary_dropout_risk is the SQL code for a project I undertook at at internship before my first data analyst job.

All other files are SQL code for personal projects I started as an aspiring data analyst, also before landing my first data analyst job.

For a better representation of my current capabilities, please take a look at the SQL or PBI files in the campus_enrollment or program_information folders.
