Thank you for visiting my Portfolio Projects!

At the time of writing this, it has been nearly two years since I began my journey in Data Analytics. I first developed my interest in analytics through my MBA, learning all the cool wizardry available in Excel.
Since then, my expertise has extended into SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. The further I've gotten into analytics, the more I've loved it! I always hoped to find a career field that I could wake up in the morning 
and actually feel energized and excited about spending the day in, and I'm happy to say that the last couple years in analytics have made that dream come true.

The beginner_projects folder contains code files of some of the projects I worked on as an aspiring data analyst and during my internship. Feel free to give these a look, but I highly encourage you to review the
campus_enrollment and program_information folders to get a better sense of my daily work and current capabilities in SQL and Power BI. Regarding the Power BI dashboard files, making the PBI files available to
download is my most practical solution rather than hosting them on a service for easier viewing, so I thank you in advance for your patience.
